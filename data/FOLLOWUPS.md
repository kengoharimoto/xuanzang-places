# Follow-ups noted during coding

- **Gaiji codes in T2087**: `data/ref/t2087_joined.txt` writes rare characters as `mNNNNN` (m03474 呾, m10370 㤄,
  m16476 殑, m20544 猱, m22129 痆, m23653 瞢, m25561 窣, m25946 笯, m27246 紇, m40981 鑊, m42434 霫, m42889 鞞…).
  `t_route` keeps them (verbatim check); a mapping table would make the routes readable.
- **Middle Chinese readings** (`mc_reading`) are often garbled by the OCR and marked "(OCR)": clean against the page
  images if the readings are wanted.
- **12.06 瞢健**: Mizutani reports Beal's view as Munjān; Beal's heading says Munjan, but his note (vol. 1 n. 144)
  puts Mung-kin around Talikan–Khanabad, i.e. agreeing with Mizutani.
- **Duplicate gazetteer scans**: several volumes exist in two scans (Jhelam 1907, Monghyr 1909/1960, Lyallpur 1905,
  Karnal 1884, Meerut 1875, Khulna, Manbhum, Midnapore…): count passages, not hits, in the report.
- **Places missing from the master table** found by the gazetteer coders (`xz_id = new`): the great Brahmanical
  city on Takka's eastern border (Lahore, per the Lahore/Punjab gazetteers); the Aśoka stūpa NW of Sthāneśvara
  (Karnal 1976); the Aśoka stūpa south of Siṃhapura (Stein, Jhelam gazetteer). More in `data/coded/gaz_batch*.tsv`.
- **Mizutani's slips** noted by coders: Kashipur coordinates with N/E swapped (04.12); "Eastern Ghats" for the
  western range (pdf 355).
- **Misfiled volume in the gazetteer study**: `in.ernet.dli.2015.281327`, listed as CP10 "Chhindwara", is a reprint
  of Beal's *Buddhist Records* (vol. IV of a reprint), not a gazetteer (found while coding batch 2; all its hits coded
  `relevant=no`). The gazetteer-vedanta selection table needs fixing, and any CP10 counts there are suspect.
